# interactive-segmentation-editor
A web based interactive image annotation tool. We provide two possible instantiations of guidance, i.e., IOG-Click and IOG-Scribble. IOG-Click is based on [Inside-Outside-Guidance (IOG)](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2020/papers/Zhang_Interactive_Object_Segmentation_With_Inside-Outside_Guidance_CVPR_2020_paper.pdf) and the IOG-Scribble is an improved version, which represents the object-of-interest with a coarse scribble.
